strava-connector
================

A .net wrapper around the Strava version 1 API, written in C#. Although the version 3 API will make this obsolete, it should be useful in the meantime.

The connector provides access to segments, rides, efforts, and effort streams, as well as users and bike models. It does not support functionality that requires authentication.
